=begin Implementation:

The basic strategy: get a list of all the references, attempt to
free the memory, and check the references.  If the memory is free,
they'll be undefined.

References to be tested are kept as references to references.  For
convenience, I will call these ref-refs.  They're necessary for
testing both weak and strong references.

If you copy a weak reference, the result is a strong reference.
There may be good reasons for it, but that behavior is a big problem
for this module.  Copying is difficult to avoid because a lot of
useful Perl constructs copy their arguments implicitly.  Creating
strong refs to the weak refs allows the code to avoid directly
manipulating the weak refs, ensuring they stay weak.

In dealing with strong references, I also need references to
references, but for a different reason.  In keeping the strong
references around to test that they go to undefined when released,
there's a Heisenberg paradox or, less pretentiously, a
chicken-and-egg situation.  As long as there is an unweakened
reference, the memory will not be freed.  The solution?  Create
references to the strong references, and before the test, weaken
the first layer of references.  The weak refs will allow their
strong refs to be freed, but the defined-ness of the strong refs
can still be tested via the weak refs.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Frees memory, and
checks that the memory
is deallocated.
Also checks deallocation of any memory referred to indirectly
through arrays, hashes, and weak and strong references.
Arrays, hashes and references are followed
recursively and to unlimited depth.

Circular references are handled 
gracefully.
In fact,
a major purpose of C<Test::Weaken> is to test schemes for
deallocating circular references.

=head1 METHOD

=head2 poof

The C<poof> static method
takes a closure as its only argument.
This closure, the B<test object constructor>,
should build the B<test object>
and create a B<primary test reference> to it.
The return value of the test object constructor must be
the primary test reference.
The test object should be created as much as possible
within the test object constructor,
because that makes it easier to construct a
test object which has no references into it from C<poof>'s
calling environment.
More on this below.

By recursively
following references, arrays and hashes
from the primary test reference, C<poof>
finds all of the references in the test object.
These are C<poof>'s B<test references>.
In recursing through the test object,
C<poof> keeps track of visited references.
C<poof> never visits the same reference twice,
and therefore has no problem
when it has to deal with a test object which contains circular references.

In scalar context,
C<poof> returns the number of unfreed test references.
If all memory was deallocated successfully, this number will be zero.

In array context, C<poof>
returns a list
with four elements.
First, the starting count of weak references.
Second, the starting count of strong references.
Third, a reference
to an array containing references to the unfreed weak references.
Fourth, a reference to an array containing references to the unfreed
strong references.

If C<@result> is the result array from a call to C<poof>,
then the number of strong references that were freed can be calculated
as

    $result[1] - @{$result[3]}

that is,
the starting count of strong references,
less the size of the array containing the unfreed strong references.
Similarly, the count of freed weak references will be

    $result[0] - @{$result[2]}

The unfreed references in the arrays can be dereferenced
and the unfreed data examined.
This may offer a clue to locate the source of a memory leak.

One technique a programmer can use to find memory leaks,
is to add tags to the arrays and hashes inside his data object as it is created.
These tags can indicate the point of creation of the objects.
Once C<poof>'s test object is tagged in this manner,
C<poof>'s list of unfreed references can be dereferenced to find the
tags.
The result will be a listing of all the sources of memory leaks.

The name C<poof> is intended to warn the programmer that the test
is destructive.  I originally called the main subroutine C<destroy>,
but that choice seemed unfortunate because of similarities to
C<DESTROY>, a name reserved for object destructors.

Obtaining the primary test reference
from a test object constructor
may seem
roundabout.
In fact, this indirect method is the easiest.
The test object must not have any strong references to
it from outside.
It takes some craft
to create and pass an object without holding
a reference to it.
Mistakes are easy to make.
If a mistake were made, and C<poof>'s calling environment held
a strong reference into the test object,
not all memory would be freed.
If this happened by accident,
so that the programmer was not aware of what was going on,
the effect would be a false negative.
Errors like this are tricky to detect and
hard to debug.

If the test object is constructed completely within the test object constructor,
and the only objects used to construct
it are all in the scope of the test object constructor, 
there will be
no strong references held from outside the test object
once the test object constructor returns.
Following this discipline, it is relatively easy
for a careful programmer to avoid false negatives.

=head1 EXPORT

By default, C<Test::Weaken> exports nothing.  Optionally, C<poof> may be exported.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

C<Test::Weaken> does not look inside code references.

=head1 IMPLEMENTATION

C<Test::Weaken> first recurses through the test object.
It follows all weak and strong references, arrays and hashes.
The test object is explored to unlimited depth.
Visited references are tracked, and no reference is visited
twice.
Two lists of test references into the original data are generated.
One list is of strong test references and the other is of weak test references.

As it recurses,
C<Test::Weaken> creates a B<probe reference> for every test
reference.
The probe references to the strong test references are weakened,
so that the probe reference will not interfere with normal deallocation of memory.

When all the probe references have been created,
the primary test reference is set to C<undef>.
Normally, this is expected to cause all
memory for the test object to be deallocated.
To check this, C<Test::Weaken> dereferences the probe references.
If the referent of the probe reference was deallocated,
the value of the probe references will be C<undef>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

Potential users will want to compare L<Test::Memory::Cycle> and
L<Devel::Cycle>, which examine existing structures non-destructively.
L<Devel::Leak> also covers similar ground, although it requires
Perl to be compiled with C<-DDEBUGGING> in order to work.  L<Devel::Cycle>
looks inside closures if PadWalker is present, a feature C<Test::Weaken>
does not have at present.
